<h1>Assignment: HTML Table</h1><br>

<b>Welcome to another Core assignment!</b> Some students like to explore the assignments before they're finished reading through the lessons, and that's okay! It can be good for your brain to have a preview of what your future challenges might be. However, before you begin this assignment, it's important that you've first:

<li>Completed the preceding lesson modules</li><br>

<li>Taken the knowledge checks to confirm your understanding</li><br>

<li>Viewed lecture material related to the assignment topics</li><br>

<li>Completed and submitted your practice assignments</li><br>

<h2>Now, the Assignment:</h2><br>

As you need to get into the habit of making your assignment look nice, we challenge you to use either <b>Bootstrap</b> or <b>Foundation</b>. If you haven't dabbled with these frameworks, start by learning just enough to do this assignment (creating a nice looking table).<br>
